# KegBot

KegBot includes source for interfacing with various sensors to an Arduino (see [KegBoard](http://github.com/Yelp/kegbot/tree/master/KegBoard/)), to an application running on an iPad (see [KegBot](http://github.com/Yelp/kegbot/tree/master/KegBot/)).

We will be updating the documentation shortly to include details on how to connect these devices and how to setup and install the apps.

For more information see the [Wiki](http://wiki.github.com/Yelp/kegbot/).
