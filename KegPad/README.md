# KegPad

KegPad is the iPad interface in the KegMate project.

## Admin

Tap the bottom left of the screen to pull up the admin interface, which is very basic at the moment.

## Importing

To import beers, kegs and users, see the JSON files in Resources/Fixtures/. These files are automatically read on startup and any data here is imported and updated. This is just temporary until the admin interface is built out.
