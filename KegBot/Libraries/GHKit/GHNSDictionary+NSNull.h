@interface NSDictionary (GHNSNull)

/*!
 Create dictionary which supports nil values.
 Key is first (instead of value then key). If the value is nil it is stored internally as NSNull,
 and when calling objectMaybeNilForKey will return nil.
 
 For example,
	[NSDictionary gh_dictionaryWithKeysAndObjectsMaybeNil:@"key1", nil, @"key2", @"value2", @"key3", nil, nil];
 
 @param firstObject... Alternating key, value pairs. Terminated when _key_ is nil. 
 */

/*!
 Use this method instead of objectForKey if you want nil (and not the internal NSNull).
